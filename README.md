# Finance control (i.e. Profitocracy)

Welcome to Profitocracy finance control app source code! There you can explore the inner logic of the app.

## Introduction

Profitocracy - unofficial finance control application name. It helps you with controlling your expenses using the division of expenses into 3 groups: main, secondary and postponed. The algorithm of application logic is so:

- You specify your billing periods. Often it's the days when you recieve your salary. For example, it's 5 and 20 dates of every months. Or you can set it to once a month and mark recieving of your second parts of salary as a transaction;
- Then you specify your initial balance for this billing period. It's the money you can spend at the moment;
- The next step is to add your transactions you made to application. For example, for purchasing a products in shop or fuel for your car etc.
